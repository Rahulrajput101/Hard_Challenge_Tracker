# Hard Challenge Tracker

This repository contains "75 Hard Tacker" app source code.

Its purpose being, to quickly demonstrate Android, Kotlin and software development in general. The main focus of this project is:
- Setup and Gradle configuration,
- Clean architecture,
- Clean code,
- Navigation Graphs,
- Light/ Dark theme,
- Best practices,
- All those other must know goodies.

## Below is a list of goodies that are being showcased:

1. Architectural Patterns
    1. [Modularization](https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/modularizing-android-applications-9e2d18f244a0)
       ```(Modularize the App Horizontally by Features)```
    2. [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) ```(Navigation refers to the interactions that
       allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app)```
    3. [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) ```(By employing
       clean architecture, you can design applications with very low coupling and independent of technical implementation
       details, such as databases and frameworks. That way, the application becomes easy to maintain and flexible to change.
       It also becomes intrinsically testable.)```
2. UI Patterns
    1. [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) ```(Model View ViewModel)```
    2. [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) ```(Architecture Components
       ViewModel Class)```
3. Kotlin
    1. [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) ```(A modern programming language that makes developers happier)```
    2. [Kotlin Symbol Processing](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-overview.html) ```(Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) is
       an API that you can use to develop lightweight compiler plugins. KSP provides a simplified compiler plugin API that
       leverages the power of Kotlin while keeping the learning curve at a minimum. Compared to kapt, annotation processors
       that use KSP can run up to 2 times faster)```
    3. [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html) ```(Coroutines simplify asynchronous
       programming by putting the complications into libraries. The logic of the program can be expressed sequentially in a
       coroutine, and the underlying library will figure out the asynchrony for us)```
    4. [Asynchronous Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) ```(Suspending functions
       asynchronously returns a single value, but how can we return multiple asynchronously computed values? This is where
       Kotlin Flows come in)```
4. Android Support
    1. [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/androidx-overview) ```(A new package
       structure to make it clearer which packages are bundled with the Android operating system, and which are packaged with
       your app's APK)```
    2. [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) ```(Android KTX is a set of Kotlin extensions that is part of
       the Android Jetpack family)```
    3. [Room Persistence Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) ```(The Room persistence
       library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full
       power of SQLite)```
5. Android UI
    1. [Material Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) ```(Modular and customizable
       Material Design UI components for Android)```
    2. [Dark Theme](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme) ```(Dark theme is available in
       Android 10 (API level 29) and higher)```
    3. [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) ```(Jetpack Compose simplifies and accelerates UI
       development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs)```
6. Build
    1. [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl) ```(Kotlin language support for Gradle build scripts)```
